Call Tracking by Message Metric.

== Description ==

[Message Metric](http://www.messagemetric.com) call tracking empowers businesses to find and identify the
marketing campaigns that create phone calls. Our WordPress plugin is very
easy-to-install and allows you to dynamically swap one or more phone numbers
displayed on any page of your website based on referral sources. We can track
how visitors find your website and call your business.

For example, you can have one or more tracking numbers to do things like:

* Track all calls on 1 number.
* Track visitors from PPC ads.  (Direct integration w/ Google Adwords conversions)
* Track visitors from Organic Search.
* Track direct referral visitors from sites like Yelp, Foursquare, Directories, etc.

To get started you simply install the wordpress plugin, connect to your
Message Metric Call Tracking Account, choose the JavaScript option and the
number or numbers you want replaced with any rules and weâ€™ll automatically
replace the phone number on your website with the appropriate tracking phone
number based on your rules.
